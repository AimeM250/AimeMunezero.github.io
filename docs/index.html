                  which are crucial for the development of Conversational AI. At that time, it was challenging to find Large Language Models capable of interacting with these lesser-known languages.

                In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Data Engineer at REG (Rwanda Energy Group), where I contributed to an ambitious project aimed at digitizing Rwanda's energy sector. The project's goal was to transition from traditional, manual operations to a modern, digital framework, to enhance efficiency and reliability.  The shift was critical for REG, as it was a way to streamline its operations, reduce losses, 
                and improve revenues through better energy distribution

                acquisition system. These ERDs were pivotal in outlining how data would be structured and interrelated across the system, enabling us to track and minimize energy losses. Our goal was to achieve a notable  reduction in energy losses across six different functional departments, which would not only improve efficiency 
                but also enhance the sustainability of the energy sector in Rwanda.

                on software development using Laravel (a PHP framework). I implemented functions to make custom charts using p5.js to represent data in a more fun and easy to parse way and also used Chart.js to create

                  In the project, we used the IMDb dataset and did an ETL process with Sqoop, Hive, and Python to create a network algorithm that maps actor-director 
                  connections and evaluates their impact on film success.
                   Our approach improves casting accuracy, fosters industry collaborations, and optimizes team composition which strongly benefits the film industry.

                During my free time, I love to play soccer and basketball, and watching sports matches is one of my favorite pastimes. 
                In the week leading up to the Super Bowl, as everyone was eager to know information about the players, their stats, and their odds in the game, 
                I was inspired to come up with an idea to fine-tune a language model 
                that is open-source using current data from NFL website containing all the necessary info and stats about all league players in the season.
                
                I explored Hugging Face, a leading platform for open-source models,
                 then decided to use the Llama-2-7b-chat model by meta and used the official 2023 National Football League Record Fact Book as my data source.
                  I developed a simple app demo that allows users to ask about any player's stats and information through user prompts. The project not only fulfilled my
                   interests but also yielded impressive results and received excellent reviews.
